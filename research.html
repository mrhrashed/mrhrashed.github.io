			  <p>The rapid growth of sensor devices in the internet of things (IoT) has resulted in that the amount of available digital data is exponentially increasing. This has powered the emergence of data-driven applications such as computer vision, natural language processing, and search. These new applications have endless computing demands that cannot be met by today’s high performance computing systems. Unfortunately, these demands are not expected to be solved by further scaling silicon technology due to the slowdown of Moore’s law, the end of Dennard scaling, and the von-Neumann bottleneck. Solving this grand computing efficiency challenge has been the focus of several federal funding agenesis, with multiple billion dollar investments on programs such as the exascale computing project (ECP), the brain initiative (BRAIN), and the joint university microelectronics program (JUMP). My research is aligned with these efforts and aims at developing future computing systems based on emerging hardware. These computing systems promise substantial (orders of magnitude) improvements in throughput and energy-efficiency. The high-level idea of this research direction is to leverage emerging non-volatile memories (NVMs) and perform energy-efficient processing in-memory (PIM). The solution strategy allows otherwise expensive operations such as matrix-vector multiplication to be performed efficiently. Moreover, the processing in-memory eliminates the expensive data movement between the processor and the memory. Within this research direction, I have made several key contributions towards the robustness, scalability, and energy-efficiency of such systems (cited below).</p>
