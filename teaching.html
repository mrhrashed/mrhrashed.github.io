            I'm the sole instructor of the <a href="course.html" target="_blank"><b>ECE 590-7061</b></a> course at Duke University in Fall 2021. This course incorporates state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to solve many hardware design problems and is aimed towards graduate students and senior undergraduate students with interest in hardware systems and machine learning. 
            The adoption of machine learning by hardware design engineers is relatively new and is yet to reach the next generation of students. According to the Linkedln 2020 Emerging Jobs report, hiring growth for machine learning has grown 74% annually in the past 4 years. Education and hardware design industries are among the top three sectors driving this growth in hiring (besides software/IT sector). 
            Therefore, there is an immediate demand of engineers who can apply machine learning algorithms to solve hardware design problems, both in academia and in the chip design industry. This course aims to address these needs and introduce students to how machine learning can be applied in hardware research.
