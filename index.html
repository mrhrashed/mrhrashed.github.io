				<p>
					I am an Assistant Professor at University of Houston. Previously, I was a Postdoc (CI-Fellow) working with 
					my mentor Dr. Krishnendu Chakrabarty at Duke University. 
					Before starting at Duke, I was a PhD candidate at Washington State University where I was advised by Dr. Partha Pratim Pande 
					and Dr. Janardhan Rao Doppa. I completed my undergraduate at the Department of Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering, 
					Jadavpur University, India. Apart from research, I enjoy going out on hikes and watching football (soccer). 
					I also spend a lot of time reading about a variety of topics. You can find my CV <a href="Biresh-Joardar-CV.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
