<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>I am an incoming tenure-track assistant professor in the CSE department at the University of Texas at Arlington. I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Engineering at the University of Central Florida. I received my bachelor's degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET). My research interests include EDA for emerging computing paradigms, computer-aided design, artificial intelligence, and computer architecture. I have published my research findings in flagship electronics design automation and computer architecture venues such as TCAD, DAC, MICRO, ICCAD, and DATE.</p>
<p>I have received a nomination for the IEEE/ACM William J. McCalla Best Paper Award at ICCAD 2022. I have won the Best Research Video Award as a young fellow at DAC 2021. I have received the prestigious David T. and Jane M. Donaldson Memorial Graduate Scholarship in 2022, and the Dr. Alireza Seyedi Doctoral Research Innovation Scholarship in 2024.</p>
